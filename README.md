# KenzieHub (Registration and login)

This was a Kenzie's Academy challenge, made with React, SASS for customization, Toastify library for the popups, Zod for validation and Axios for the integration with the API. 
For this project, I used an API provided by Kenzie Academy, that can be found in <a href="https://kenziehub.herokuapp.com"> this </a> public URL: <a href="https://kenziehub.herokuapp.com"> this </a>
